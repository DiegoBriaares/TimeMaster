# TimeMaster
A versatile time tracking and management application. It allows users to start, pause, and reset a main timer, displaying the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can create sub-timers, each with its own individual time count, to keep track of multiple tasks or activities simultaneously. The app features a "Rest" button that pauses the main timer and sub-timers, allowing users to take breaks without interrupting the overall time tracking. A "Resume" button then continues the main timer and sub-timers after the rest period. Additionally, the application alerts users with a sound when the main timer reaches a multiple of 25 minutes. "TimeMaster" is ideal for optimizing productivity, managing time, and staying focused on various tasks throughout the day.
